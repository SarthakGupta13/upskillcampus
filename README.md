Project Problem Statement

India, a prominent agricultural powerhouse, holds a significant position as the second largest producer of key food staples such as wheat and rice on a global scale. However, Indian agriculture faces numerous challenges, including unpredictable weather patterns, limited access to resources, inefficient farming practices, and fluctuating market demands. To address these challenges and improve crop production, there is a need to leverage machine learning techniques on relevant datasets. The problem statement aims to develop a machine learning model that can analyse agricultural data and provide insights and predictions to optimize crop production in India. The model will utilize a dataset containing information on various factors influencing crop yield, such as climate conditions, soil properties, irrigation methods, fertilizer usage, pest and disease management, and historical crop yield data. The goal of the project is to design a machine learning solution that can assist farmers, agricultural researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions to enhance agricultural productivity.
